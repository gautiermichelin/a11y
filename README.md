# !(a11y icon)[https://github.com/gautiermichelin/a11y/blob/main/a11y_icon.png?raw=true] a11y-menu

The goal of this project is to bring to life in a single JS file an accessibility file, self loading.
It should bring these functionalities :
- ability to increase/decrease the font size, without zooming on the images, from 50% to 150% of the actual font size
- ability to fix single letter horizontal space to a single value, increasing readability for ppl that have difficulties to read, reading letter to letter
- ability to toggle the font family, to use at least one readable "sans" font, actually Open Sans (that could change in the future) ; and at least one specific font, OpenDyslexic
- this menu should insert at the top of the page, expanding full width (to be sure we don't break the current design of the page)
